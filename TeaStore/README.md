In the folder [model-1](./model-1) you can find the model used by Akin Asik in his bachelor's thesis.

Another version of the model can be found in the folder [CIPM-model](./CIPM-model). It is a copy of the version that can be found in the [CIPM-tools/CIPM-Pipeline repository on github](https://github.com/CIPM-tools/CIPM-Pipeline) at their evaluation project ([direct link](https://github.com/CIPM-tools/CIPM-Pipeline/tree/master/cipm.consistency.root/cipm.consistency.tools.evaluation/teastore_models)).
