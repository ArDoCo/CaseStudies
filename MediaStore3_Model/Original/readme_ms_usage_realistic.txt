README realistic usage scenario

== Interarrival time ==

Exponentially distributed inter-arrival time with mean 25.000 seconds. So 25000 milliseconds, so Exp(1 / 25000) = Exp(0.00004)

== User Delays ==

We have estimated the user delay based on our experience with similar systems to be 3 seconds on average for a simple screen and 6 seconds for a complex screen, such as the list of files. To account for the variance among users, we modelled the delay as a normal distribution, which is appropriate in many situations as described by the Microsoft Performance Testing Guidance for Web Applications, Chapter 13. We estimate the variance to be one second.
