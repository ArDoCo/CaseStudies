# Overview

## [BigBlueButton](./BigBlueButton)

"BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for online learning. The goal of BigBlueButton is to enable instructors to engage remote student in a high-quality online learning experience." - from BigBlueButton Documentation

There is architecture documentation, but the descriptions is on a rather high level describing (high level) parts of the architecture. Barely/only implicitly describes constraints.

## [MediaStore](./MediaStore3_Model)

Small example project for Palladio. Some architecture documentation can be found in the Book "Modeling and Simulating Software Architectures - The Palladio Approach".

There are also palladio models, but overall the example is rather small and might be too artificial.

## [TEAMMATES](./TEAMMATES)

"TEAMMATES is a free online tool for managing peer evaluations and other feedback paths of your students. It is provided as a cloud-based service for educators/students and is currently used by hundreds of universities across the world." - from Github project README

Established project that has some architecture description as well as architectural rules (e.g. in the form of ArchUnit tests).

TEAMMATES was used by Sandra Schröder and Matthias Riebisch to evaluate their approach presented at ECSA2018 where architectural rules are described in controlled natural language and are then transformed into SWRL to check them with ontologies:<br>

## [TeaStore](./TeaStore)

Case study created in academics. Purpose is mainly evaluation of performance approaches and similar. There is some documentation in the paper describing the case study. (PCM) Models might be derived with the help of pmx and/or SoMoX.

## [Apache OFBiz](./OFBiz)

"Apache OFBiz is a suite of business applications flexible enough to be used across any industry. A common architecture allows developers to easily extend or enhance it to create custom features."
There is some documentation about the architecture, esp. focusing on components.
